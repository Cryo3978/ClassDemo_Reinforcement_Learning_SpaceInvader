# ClassDemo: Reinforcement Learning with Space Invaders

**Author:** Shuheng Chen, University of Southern California (USC)

This repository contains a demonstration of applying **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to the classic arcade game *Space Invaders*. It is designed for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

- **Play the Game (Human Mode):**  
  Run `Space_Invaders_human.py` to play the game manually and explore its dynamics.

- **Reinforcement Learning Training & Evaluation:**  
  Run `main.py` to train RL agents and evaluate their performance.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed, including `gym` and any dependencies required for RL training.
